Welcome to Gabrielle Eula's official website! Gabrielle is a professional, certified makeup artist and beauty services provider. Her services range from makeup services for events to nails and lash services. 

The website uses Ruby 2.6.1. To get started, run bundle install to load gems. 

The website allows a user to create an account via a sign up page. Once an account is created, a user can log in manually or via their google account (omniauth). While logged in, a user can write a review for a service they've received by the make up artist. Users are able to review other reviews and leave comments. They are able to delete the comments they've made. When a review is selected, the user will be able to see the review content as well as any and all comments made by all users. 

This space hopes to serve as a community for the client base for Gabrielle Eula. 

Moving forward, I would like to expand this website to allow people to optionally upload photos of their servies to their review and provide a rating from 1 to 5 stars.
